  <h3><a href="http://kellyrand.bigcartel.com/product/marketing-your-creative-business">Marketing Your Creative Business</a></h3>
    <p>You've done your research, designed an amazing product line or list of services, and set out your shingle to alert people you're open for business. But no one's coming in, yet. In this two part marketing workshop, we'll teach you how to market your creative business in a smart and effective way to find your customers and make them into fans.</p>
    <p>In Part One: "Old school" you'll learn marketing 101 which will lay a solid foundation for your future outreach. From finding your audience, to press releases and print advertising, you'll walk away with an understanding of what magazine and newspaper writers need and want to be able to write about you. </p>
    <p>In Part Two: "New school" we'll build upon the lessons learned in "Old school" and teach you how to apply those lessons to the online world. We'll talk about paid and earned media online and how to run effective online outreach tailored to your business.</p>
    <p>As a part of this workshop series, you'll receive digital handouts such as a sample press list, a sample press release and more. All aimed at helping you to hit the ground running.</p>
    <p><i>Hosted by Lisa Rowan of Beltway Vintage and Kelly Rand, author of Handmade to Sell</i></p>
