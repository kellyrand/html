I’ve had this idea for a long time; crafting will save the world. It stems from my writing and work at Crafting a Green World and is an arm of my work on my first book: Handmade to Sell. This idea has been festering for a while, but I’ve struggled to put it into focus and set it to paper.

I’d committed myself to writing a new book proposal and in doing so, committed to restarting my writing practice. It’s something that I struggle with. I procrastinate like no one’s business. Writing doesn’t come easy for me so I find all these other things to do instead. Bathroom needs cleaning? Book needs reading? Internetting needs doing? Check, check and check. Anything and everything, except writing.

When I finally tied myself to a chair and started fleshing out my new book proposal, my writing took off and into areas that were bigger and broader than the scope of the book. I’d sit and write and my mind would take a journey into far off places about things that I clearly wanted to explore about just HOW crafting will save the world. I knew the topics weren’t a fit for the narrower scope of the proposal but they were about crafting and making and their intersection with the environment and the broader world in general. I felt stuck because this wasn’t what the proposal was supposed to be about. I did feel excited because I was finally putting to paper the hows and why crafting would save the world.

I took a break and a step back. While I was making progress on the larger theme, I wasn’t any closer to a finished book proposal. The break was long enough that I allowed myself back into procrastination mode. I then got it into my head that I would complete the ultimate form of procrastination. I would learn to code my own website. From the ground up.

The result is what you see today (with lots of generous help). A new look and feel and most importantly a surprise focus for my work going forward. You see, even though I was procrastinating, I’d given myself room to explore the larger themes from my book proposal and give them a home; give the idea that crafting will save the world a space to breath and live. This site allows me to explore what I want to do and be within this world.

It’s not perfect, but it’s a start.

And the new book proposal isn’t dead, its theme fits quite nicely within this broader framework. I just don’t have an excuse to procrastinate on it anymore.

I hope you join me on this journey of crafting, making and the exploration of its place within our world and society and come along as I figure out how crafting will really save the world.
