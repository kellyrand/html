      <p class="lead">How will it save the world, you ask?</p>
      <p>Hand making is found throughout our daily lives. It&rsquo;s in the products we choose to buy, to the food we serve at our tables. It&rsquo;s in our handicraft traditions and is a business opportunity. From the women&rsquo;s artisans associations in Peru to the Stitch n&rsquo; Bitch gatherings in Cleveland, to the FabLab at MIT, to the U.S.&rsquo;s manufacturing resurgence, making is part of our DNA.</p>
      <p>Making is a special and magical thing. When you create something and can point to it and say &ldquo;I made that,&rdquo; it can spark a crafty revolution. One that via it&rsquo;s inherent eco-friendly qualities, abilities to preserve a tradition, and teach a skill, will ultimately save the world.</p>

<h1>Grown up Bio</h1>
<p>Kelly Rand is fearless in her crafting and usually keeps a too large of a pile of &ldquo;to craft items,&rdquo; while she compulsively finds and knits projects in her attempt to thin out her yarn stash. Her wickedly dark sense of humor lead her to knit inappropriate items, while her obsession with yarn and background in the environmental community turned into finding and writing about environmentally friendly yarns for Crafting a Green World, a blog about sustainable crafting.</p>
<p>Here, Kelly took her love of yarn and green crafting, and knitted her way up to Site Editor where she grew the blog&rsquo;s audience for three years. Kelly continues to contribute to the site.</p>
<p>Her foray into writing extends into the blogosphere as well as print medium. Kelly covered visual arts in and around Washington, D.C. for DCist (a part of the Gothamist group) a popular local news blog about the District of Columbia. Kelly also rose to that of Arts Editor for the site for one year. You can also find her byline at Indie Fixx, the Maven Circle and Etsy&rsquo;s blog on the topics of green crafting and handmade businesses. She has taught in Etsy&rsquo;s virtual lab on the topic of green crafting and presented in Etsy&rsquo;s lab on Starting a Handmade Business.</p>
<p>In print, Kelly has been published by Bust Magazine and The Crafts Report. Kelly is also the lead author of the book, Handmade to Sell: Hello Craft&rsquo;s Guide to Owning, Running and Growing your Crafty Business (Potter Craft, 2012).</p>
<p><strong>Praise For Handmade to Sell&hellip;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a crafter who&rsquo;s dreaming of quitting your day job, this book will provide you the necessary know-how. Hello Craft is a non-profit trade association dedicated to crafters and the handmade movement, and their insider knowledge makes them a natural (and adorable) guide to its nuances.&rdquo; -BUST Magazine</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once you have a business plan in place, how do you DO a business?... This book demystifies the art of pricing, branding, and photographing your work; helps you understand tricky concepts like copyright and taxes; and prepares you to sell in face-to-face venues (like fairs) and online.&rdquo; -Bead and Button Magazine</p></blockquote>
<p>Kelly helps organize Crafty Bastards: Arts and Crafts Fair. Now, in its tenth year, Crafty Bastards is considered one of the largest indie craft fairs on the East coast. Kelly has served on the Craft Bastard&rsquo;s jury since 2007. Kelly is also co-founder of Hello Craft a non-profit trade association for independent crafters and makers and host of the Summit of Awesome a business conference for indie crafters. Her responsibilities as a Executive Director of the organization include programing for the Summit of Awesome and coordinator of the membership program.</p>
<p>Kelly received her BFA from the Savannah College of Art and Design in illustration and has exhibited work at art galleries and craft fairs alike. Kelly resides in Washington, D.C. and believes that handmade will save the world.</p>
